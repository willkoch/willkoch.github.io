Third, create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.


Software engineering is something that I am basically just starting to do. I feel really good about taking a class on it as I feel it is one of the weakest parts of my skillset right now, but I know that needs to improve. Right now most of my work experience in the area of computer science can be summed up by little scripting projects for productivity or quality assurance. On the academic side, I have taken a lot of classes to help me understand how a computer works and the architecture behind it. The problem is that when I think of an idea, I don't have the software engineering knowledge to know how I can implement that, and it gets a bit overwhelming. There are so many languages and programs you can choose from, and I don't even have the background of knowledge to know where to get started. Having that knowledge is my biggest
