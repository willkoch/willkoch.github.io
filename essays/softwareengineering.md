## Background

Software engineering is something that I am basically just starting to do. I feel really good about taking a class on it as I feel it is one of the weakest parts of my skillset right now, but I know that needs to improve. Right now most of my work experience in the area of computer science can be summed up by little scripting projects for productivity or quality assurance. On the academic side, I have taken a lot of classes to help me understand how a computer works and the architecture behind it, but very little that even touches on the beginning to end process of software engineering.

## The Problem

The problem I have is that when I think of an idea, I don't have the software engineering knowledge to know how I can implement that, and it gets a bit overwhelming. There are so many languages and environments you can choose from, and I don't even have the background of knowledge to know how to evaluate that choice for myself. Obtaining that knowledge is my primary goal. Of course, I don't want to stop there, I like to excel at the things that I do, and software engineering is no different. I want to be able to whip up a web application like it's nothing when all is said and done. I fully intend to participate in a few hackathons to get just that experience, and in a group environment as well.

## The Future

As far as my career path, my current plans do not include frontend web design, but I think that being a well rounded software engineer requires that knowledge, and being comfortable with the full-stack is an asset. Acquiring that "ground up" knowledge is another of my goals that I think can be accomplished over the next few months, at least the basic stage. Part of being a software engineer or any developing professional in any area is the continual improvement that you must make a part of your routine. Right now I am building that routine as a student and I will keep my eyes on the prize as I move towards my goals.
