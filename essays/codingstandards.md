If there is one thing that I am particularly good at, it is following processes. This has always been the case for me, but I really honed it during my time as an incident manager. When documenting an outage, the format had to be consistent, phrasing had to be consistent...basically consistency was key. This consistency was required to make sure that the data being recorded was easy to read and usable to refer back to in the future. That usability must also be true not just for your future self, but a third party, and I think this is what is so important about following strict coding standards. 

Following strict coding standards is a necessity in my mind when you are operating in a team. If you are by yourself, with no potential for your code to ever be used by another, itâ€™s not such a big deal. Based on my experience, once a person is established in a programming language, that person generally has their own internal standard they follow that is internally consistent and allows them to understand their own code. The idea behind implementing and enforcing coding standards that are uniform for everyone is to make coders interchangeable. If Charlie is moved to a different project or is on vacation, Susan can look at his code and pick up where he left off without spending days deciphering what he left (or at least not deciphering the basic formatting).

The positive benefits of coding standards also come at a cheap cost. With the ease most modern IDEs implement standards, the programmer can organically learn and adjust habits as they go by making the flagged corrections. When I am using ESLint, after just a week I find myself correcting things I know it will not like before it can even tell me that. I imagine there would be more pains adjusting to a new process for someone who has been coding a different way for ten or twenty years, but I think that anyone can learn this way without much effort. Overall I am a big fan of coding standards
