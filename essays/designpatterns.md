## When is devising a solution to a problem a bad thing?

The answer to this provocative question is...when it has already been solved! Time is the greatest of scarce resources, and if you have done this you have squandered it.

In programming, novel problems still abound on the fringes, but day to day tasks have been tackled for decades. You may recognize the figure in the image above from a history or mythology class. Pictured is Sisyphus, punished by the Greek gods with the task of rolling a boulder up a hill for eternity, cursed to never reach the top. Sisyphus is too busy with the same boulder he has struggled with for years to push new features for his consumer web application. 

This isn't to say he needs to copy code off of Stack Overflow. Design Patterns give a framework for solving a problem, not the tool itself. If I have a popped nail in my drywall, a Design pattern is the friendly Home Depot Associate recommending I purchase a hammer, spackle and paint. Design patterns also allow better communication with peers, a new language for problem solving once you have learned them. All of this allows time to be spent in areas that actually need it, not reinventing the wheel.

## My Efforts In Design Patterns

In terms of design patterns, I am a learning novice. One of the most frustrating parts of learning about Design patterns is the 20/20 hindsight that comes along with them. "Agh, I spent three days thinking about the logic for that and if I had just applied this design pattern..." That is a difficult revelation to stomach. One that I have employed, although not exactly knowingly, is the behavioral pattern of strategy. This seems particularly prevalant in the work I have done, hiding the logic from the user/client and doing your blackbox magic in the backend to deal with the request. This is something I have done in implementing the 'Manoa Munchies' webapp, allowing different types of users to use the same UI with different results. 

Going forward, I aim to keep as many design patterns as I can in my back pocket, ready to pull them out to address problems as needed. It feels like I am a handyman who is only just finding out he has a toolbox.
