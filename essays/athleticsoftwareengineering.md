I call this starting over with Javascript because taking a software engineering course is not entirely my first experience with it. I have not used Javascript itself particularly often, but I have spent a lot of time using Google Apps Script. I found it extremely useful for automating small productivity and quality assurance tools in my last job in coordination with Google Sheets. That being said, this is my first time where I will be going past simple data manipulation and API usage. 

I find that Javascript is very easy to use after Java, relaxing many of the rules of Java that can trip you up, while not being so wholly unstructured as Python. Like scripting or coding in any new language, there are things that have an adjustment period, but for the most part it just feels like easier Java. I do worry about future assignments with user input, that is one area where I imagine you can get into a lot of trouble when not using a strongly-typed language. 
  
So I have the opportunity now in ICS314 to learn a somewhat familiar language but in an entirely new way. Athletic software engineering that focuses on repetition and practice is not something I have done previously, and I think it will be a lot better for me. Often I take on one big project and slog through it, learning as I go, but I find this is a really poor method for my own retention of the things that I learn. I end up having to look up the same things the next go around, because they did not stick the first time. That strikes me as wasted time that doesn’t need to be used that way.
  
Not just repetition is new for me with Athletic software engineering, but the time limit aspect as well. I am a pretty fast typist at least, which is a bonus for the kind of challenges faced in the “daily workouts” or WODs. That being said, typing fast can’t save you if you don’t know where to go to solve the problem. I think I generally operate well under stress, having had a lot of practice for that in my career as an incident manager as well as during college as an EMT. I am eager to take these challenges as well because I have a bit of a competitive nature. I think it is a great motivator for learning though, and I look forward to the opportunities to test myself.
