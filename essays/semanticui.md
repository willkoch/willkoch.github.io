Semantic UI is how I have dipped my toe into the pool that is UI frameworks. I was familiar with the concept previously, but I had never actually used one myself, and I think I have been missing out. Now that I know a few of the ins-and-outs, it is the biggest time saving leap forward I have experienced while coding. It is like moving from taking one stair at a time to three at a time, or perhaps an escalator.

That’s not to say there isn’t a learning curve, I have spent a bit of time beating my head against the wall trying to figure out why it isn’t formatting how I want it to. The thing is, those issues were still happening previously also, it is the nature of HTML and CSS. But even as a novice Semantic UI was  immensely helpful and intuitive for solving the problems I encountered. Every minute you take to learn it pays back in hours of saved time almost immediately. 

There are definitely valid reasons not to use a framework, or in particular, why not to use a specific framework. The easiest thing to create with a framework is definitely a rather homogenized product, similar to almost every other modern website out there. There is nothing wrong with that, the optimized websites of today are such a huge improvement on even ten years ago, let alone the Geocities era. In creating a unique product, you can probably still benefit from what a UI gives you, though.

I think key to appreciating UI Frameworks is to just think of it as what it is, a higher level language on top of HTML/CSS. That is the essence of the evolution of programming, building additional levels of complexity to move the hard work from the human side to the machine side. So why use a framework? Why use Java instead of C++? Or C++ instead of C? Or C instead of Assembly? There are reasons to make things harder on yourself, but in my opinion web development is an area that should be taking full advantage of these high level tools.
