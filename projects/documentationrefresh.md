summary: An initiative I led to update documentation for the team I was part of (Incident Management) within Yahoo.
---


During a series of changes in company organization, it was necessary during my time with Yahoo (newly under the Oath umbrella at that time) to migrate documentation from one platform to another. This opened up an excellent opportunity to review all that documentation and go through a review and refresh process. 

The goals of this process were: 
  - Move documentation to the new platform, consolidating it from a variety of other sources. 
  - Review documentation content to ensure it was up-to-date.
  - Archive documentation that was no longer relevant, or combine redundant documentation.
  - Create a log of everything that would serve as both a table of contents and guide for future documentation refresh efforts
  
Over a couple months, several coworkers and I went through this arduous process and the result was a consolidated list of over 120 documents. Each document in the list was separated by type of content, linked to the actual content, had a record of the last changes done (this was not exhaustive, as our documentation had version control that could be referenced easily), and included the date the document was last reviewed.

Following the original process, I would head up an ongoing documentation refresh project team that would review documents every six months to continually update and curate the team's documentation. This series of projects taught me the value of ensuring documentation is centrally organized and kept up-to-date. During our work we were able to highlight and disseminate information we found to other members of the team, as well as give them an easy way to reference that information in the future. Collective recorded knowledge can only be a boon when people know it exists and know how to access it. The process itself was not difficult, merely time consuming, and it would have been a much quicker process if it had been managed from the beginning in the manner we developed.
